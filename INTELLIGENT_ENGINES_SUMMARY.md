## 🔬 **Integration with Your Existing Engines**

### **Option 1: Minimal Integration** (5 minutes per engine)
Add basic awareness to existing engines:

```python
# Add to your existing engine __init__ method
from engines.common.engine_identity import create_your_engine_identity
from engines.common.engine_discovery import EngineDiscoveryProtocol

# In your engine initialization
self.identity = create_your_engine_identity()  # Customize for your engine
self.discovery = EngineDiscoveryProtocol(self.identity)
await self.discovery.initialize()
await self.discovery.start()
```

### **Option 2: Full Integration** (20 minutes per engine)
Complete awareness with AI agents and partnerships:

```python
# Full integration example
from engines.common.partnership_manager import PartnershipManager
from engines.common.intelligent_router import MessageRouter
from engines.common.ai_agent_specialists import AIAgentCoordinator

# In your engine
self.partnerships = PartnershipManager(self.identity, self.discovery, self.router)
self.ai_agents = AIAgentCoordinator(self.identity)
```
