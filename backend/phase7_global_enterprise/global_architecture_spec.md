# Phase 7: Global Enterprise Scaling & Federation Architecture Specification

## Executive Summary

Phase 7 transforms the Nautilus platform into a globally distributed enterprise trading system with multi-region deployment, regulatory compliance across jurisdictions, and institutional-grade disaster recovery. This builds upon Phase 5's multi-cloud federation to create a truly enterprise-ready global platform.
