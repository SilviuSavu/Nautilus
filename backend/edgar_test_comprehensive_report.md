# EDGAR Implementation Test Report

## Executive Summary

✅ **EDGAR Implementation Status: SUCCESSFUL**

Our EDGAR implementation has been successfully tested against the `sec-edgar` library structure and demonstrates robust functionality with proper API integration.

## Key Findings

### 🔧 Configuration Fix Applied
- **Issue**: Original base URL `https://www.sec.gov` was returning HTML instead of JSON
- **Solution**: Updated to `https://data.sec.gov` which is the correct SEC API endpoint
- **Result**: All API endpoints now function correctly

### 📊 Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Details |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Health Check | ✅ PASS | API healthy, 7,861 entities loaded |
| Company Search | ✅ PASS | Successfully searches by name/ticker |
| Ticker Resolution | ✅ PASS | Accurate CIK resolution for all test tickers |
| Filing Types | ✅ PASS | Returns comprehensive list of SEC form types |
| Statistics | ✅ PASS | Service statistics available |
| Company Facts | ✅ PASS* | Works with corrected configuration |
