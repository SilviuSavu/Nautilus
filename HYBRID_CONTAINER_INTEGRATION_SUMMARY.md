## üéØ Key Implementation Details

### Circuit Breaker Integration
```python
# Each engine now has circuit breaker protection
self.circuit_breaker = get_circuit_breaker("engine_name")

# Critical path protection
if not await self.circuit_breaker.can_execute():
    raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Engine temporarily unavailable")

# Success/failure recording
await self.circuit_breaker.record_success()
await self.circuit_breaker.record_failure(str(error))
```

### Performance Tracking
```python
# Each engine tracks performance metrics
metric_id = self.performance_tracker.start_operation(
    HybridOperationType.CRITICAL_OPERATION.value
)

# Process with timeout for critical operations
result = await asyncio.wait_for(
    self._perform_critical_operation(data),
    timeout=0.095  # 95ms timeout for <100ms total
)

self.performance_tracker.end_operation(metric_id, success=True)
```

### Enhanced MessageBus Configuration
```python
# Hybrid-optimized MessageBus settings
self.messagebus_config = EnhancedMessageBusConfig(
    consumer_name="hybrid-{engine}-engine",
    stream_key="nautilus-{engine}-hybrid-streams",
    consumer_group="{engine}-hybrid-group",
    buffer_interval_ms=25,  # Reduced for critical operations
    max_buffer_size=50000,  # Increased for high-volume processing
    priority_topics=["{engine}.critical", "{engine}.priority"]
)
```

## üìä Performance Targets by Engine

| Engine | Critical Operation | Target Latency | Hybrid Endpoint | Circuit Breaker |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Strategy | Order Execution | <50ms | `/execute` | ‚úÖ |
| Risk | Risk Calculation | <100ms | `/critical-check` | ‚úÖ |
| Analytics | Real-time Analysis | <200ms | `/realtime` | ‚úÖ |
| ML | Neural Inference | <5ms | `/critical-predict` | ‚úÖ |
| Features | Feature Calculation | Standard | Hybrid flag | ‚úÖ |
| WebSocket | Message Delivery | <40ms | Hybrid flag | ‚úÖ |
| MarketData | Data Processing | <50ms | Hybrid flag | ‚úÖ |
| Portfolio | Position Updates | <100ms | Hybrid flag | ‚úÖ |

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

All engines maintain **100% backward compatibility** through environment variable control:

```bash
# Enable hybrid mode (default)
ENABLE_HYBRID=true

# Disable hybrid mode (fallback to simple engines)
ENABLE_HYBRID=false
```

### Entry Point Pattern
Each engine uses this pattern in their main files:
```python
# Check for hybrid mode
ENABLE_HYBRID = os.getenv("ENABLE_HYBRID", "true").lower() == "true"

if ENABLE_HYBRID:
    try:
        from hybrid_engine import hybrid_engine
        app = hybrid_engine.app
        engine_instance = hybrid_engine
    except ImportError:
        # Fallback to simple engine
        app = simple_engine.app
        engine_instance = simple_engine
```

    "failure_count": 0
  },
  "performance": {
    "operations": {...},
    "overall": {...}
  },
  "hybrid_integration": true
