```bash
# SME Production System (Grade A+)
export SME_ACCELERATION=1 M4_MAX_OPTIMIZED=1 METAL_ACCELERATION=1 NEURAL_ENGINE_ENABLED=1
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.sme.yml up --build

# Access production system
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Backend API
curl http://localhost:8200/health  # Risk Engine (SME accelerated)
curl http://localhost:8100/health  # Analytics Engine (SME accelerated)
```

### **For Development/Testing**
```bash
# Breakthrough Development System (Grade B - Experimental)
export BREAKTHROUGH_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 KERNEL_BYPASS=1 GPU_ACCELERATION=1 QUANTUM_ALGORITHMS=1
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.breakthrough.yml up --build

# Test breakthrough development
python3 test_breakthrough_optimizations_simple.py
```
