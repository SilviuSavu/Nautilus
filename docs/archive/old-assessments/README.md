## Superseded Documents

### `CURRENT_SYSTEM_STATUS_20250824.md`
- **Superseded by**: `COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT_20250824.md`
- **Reason**: More comprehensive assessment with detailed performance metrics and validation results
- **Content Gap**: Lacked detailed M4 Max optimization results and comprehensive engine status

### `PROJECT_STATUS_SPRINT3.md`
- **Superseded by**: Current production system status and documentation
- **Reason**: Sprint 3 has been completed and system is in production operation
- **Current Status**: All Sprint 3 objectives achieved and operational
