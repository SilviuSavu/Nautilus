### Data Integration Architecture - Hybrid MessageBus + REST Design

The Nautilus platform uses a **sophisticated hybrid architecture** combining event-driven MessageBus integration with traditional REST APIs, optimized for different data source characteristics and use cases.

#### MessageBus-Enabled Sources (Event-Driven Architecture)
**Current Sources**: Data.gov, DBnomics  
**Pattern**: Async event processing with pub/sub messaging via Redis streams

**When MessageBus is Used**:
- **High-volume data sources** (346K+ datasets, 800M+ time series)
- **Complex workflows** requiring async processing and queuing
- **Batch operations** that benefit from event-driven coordination
- **Data sources** where pub/sub patterns enable horizontal scaling

**MessageBus Architecture Pattern**:
```
/backend/
├── [source]_routes.py           # Traditional REST endpoints for compatibility
├── [source]_messagebus_routes.py # Event-triggered endpoints
└── [source]_messagebus_service.py # Event handlers & pub/sub logic
```

**Event Types**:
- `*.health_check` - Service health monitoring
- `*.request` - Data retrieval requests  
- `*.search` - Complex search operations
- `*.response` - Async response delivery
- `*.error` - Error handling and retry logic

#### Direct REST API Sources (Request/Response Architecture)
**Current Sources**: IBKR, Alpha Vantage, FRED, EDGAR, Trading Economics  
**Pattern**: Synchronous HTTP API calls with direct response handling

**When Direct REST is Used**:
- **Real-time trading operations** (IBKR) - latency-critical, sub-millisecond requirements
- **Simple request/response patterns** (Alpha Vantage, FRED) - no async processing needed
- **Rate-limited APIs** (Alpha Vantage: 5 req/min) - direct control for quota management
- **Regulatory data** (EDGAR) - straightforward compliance data retrieval
- **Legacy integrations** being gradually migrated to MessageBus

#### Performance & Scaling Trade-offs

| **Aspect** | **MessageBus** | **Direct REST** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Latency** | Higher (async) | Lower (direct) |
| **Throughput** | Higher (queued) | Limited (sync) |
| **Scalability** | Horizontal (pub/sub) | Vertical (connection pool) |
| **Complexity** | Higher (event handling) | Lower (simple HTTP) |
| **Error Handling** | Retry/dead letter queues | Immediate failure |
| **Rate Limiting** | Queue-based throttling | Direct API limits |

#### Decision Matrix for New Data Sources

**Use MessageBus When**:
- ✅ Data volume > 100K records/operations
- ✅ Complex multi-step processing workflows
- ✅ Batch operations and background processing
- ✅ Multiple consumers need the same data
- ✅ Horizontal scaling requirements
- ✅ Async processing acceptable

**Use Direct REST When**:
- ✅ Real-time/low-latency requirements (< 100ms)
- ✅ Simple request/response patterns
- ✅ Rate-limited external APIs requiring direct control
- ✅ Trading operations requiring immediate response
- ✅ Regulatory/compliance data with audit trails
- ✅ Legacy system integration

#### Future Migration Strategy
**Phase 1**: Continue hybrid approach for optimal performance  
**Phase 2**: Evaluate Alpha Vantage and FRED for MessageBus migration  
**Phase 3**: Keep IBKR direct for trading latency requirements  
**Phase 4**: All new sources default to MessageBus unless latency-critical  

### Network & Latency Architecture

The Nautilus platform implements a **multi-tier latency architecture** optimized for different use cases, from sub-10ms trading operations to 5-second batch processing.

#### Network Topology
```
User Browser (localhost:3000)
    ↓ HTTP/WS (Docker network)

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES & TROUBLESHOOTING (Sprint 2)

### Frontend-Backend API Structure Mismatch (FIXED)
**Problem**: Frontend shows `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')`
**Root Cause**: Backend returned nested structures by session ID, frontend expected flat objects
**Fix Location**: `/backend/nautilus_engine_service.py` lines 446-456 in `get_engine_status()`

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Flatten nested structures for single container scenarios
if len(self.dynamic_containers) == 1:
    session_id = list(self.dynamic_containers.keys())[0]
    if isinstance(resource_usage, dict) and session_id in resource_usage:
        resource_usage = resource_usage[session_id]
    if isinstance(container_info, dict) and session_id in container_info:
        container_info = container_info[session_id]
```

**Before (BROKEN)**:
```json
{
  "resource_usage": {
    "session-id-123": {"cpu_percent": "1.5%", "memory_usage": "100MB"}
  },
  "container_info": {
    "session-id-123": {"status": "running", "name": "nautilus-engine-xyz"}
  }
}
```

**After (FIXED)**:
```json
{
  "resource_usage": {"cpu_percent": "1.5%", "memory_usage": "100MB"},
  "container_info": {"status": "running", "name": "nautilus-engine-xyz"}
}
```

### Network Configuration Issues
- **Docker Network**: MUST use `nautilus_nautilus-network` (not `nautilus-network`)
- **CORS Origins**: Include both port 3000 and 3001 in docker-compose.yml
- **IB Gateway**: Use mocked imports if real nautilus_trading_node fails import

### Container Management Issues
- **Container Cleanup**: Use `docker container prune -f` to clean stopped containers
- **Image Updates**: `docker-compose build backend` to rebuild engine image
- **Health Checks**: Engine containers expose health endpoint on port 8001

### Port Configuration (DO NOT CHANGE)
- **Frontend**: localhost:3000 (Docker container)
- **Backend**: localhost:8001 (Docker container) 
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (Docker container)
- **Frontend Environment**: VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001

## Playwright Integration
- Playwright tests located in `frontend/tests/e2e/`
- Use Playwright for end-to-end workflow testing
- Playwright MCP server available for advanced automation scenarios
- Browser automation for real user interaction testing
