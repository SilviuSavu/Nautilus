# Historical Performance Reports Archive

This directory contains superseded performance analyses, benchmarking reports, and optimization documentation that has been replaced by current system performance metrics.

## Contents

### Trading Core Performance
- Historical trading engine performance analyses  
- Legacy performance benchmarking results
- Superseded by current M4 Max optimized performance

### M4 Max Optimization Journey
- Historical M4 Max deployment reports
- Step-by-step optimization implementation documents
- CPU optimization deployment results
- Monitoring system deployment reports
- Performance analysis updates throughout optimization process

### System Benchmarking  
- Historical comprehensive performance analyses
- Volume stress test results from earlier system versions
- Load testing results prior to current optimization

## Performance Evolution

### Historical Baseline (Pre-M4 Max)
- Monolithic architecture performance
- Single-threaded processing limitations
- Basic containerization performance

### Optimization Journey
- Step-by-step M4 Max hardware acceleration implementation
- CPU optimization deployment phases
- Memory and GPU acceleration integration

### Current Performance (Post-Optimization)
- **50x+ performance improvements** achieved
- **30x scalability increase** (500 â†’ 15,000+ users)
- **Sub-millisecond latency** for critical operations
- **15,000+ concurrent users** validated under stress testing

## Usage Guidelines

- **Historical Reference**: Use for understanding performance evolution journey
- **Current Metrics**: Refer to `M4_MAX_COMPREHENSIVE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` for current performance
- **Benchmarking Context**: Historical results provide baseline for measuring improvements
