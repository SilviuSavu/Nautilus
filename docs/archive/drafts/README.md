# Draft Documents Archive

This directory contains draft implementation plans, preliminary technical specifications, and planning documents that have been superseded by implemented systems.

## Contents

### Implementation Plans  
- Draft hybrid architecture implementation plans
- Sequential implementation planning documents
- System optimization execution plans
- Risk engine optimization planning

### Technical Specifications
- Preliminary technical specifications for hybrid architecture
- Draft system design documents
- Planning documents for major system changes

### Epic and Feature Planning
- Draft epic documents for major features
- Advanced risk models integration planning
- System-wide optimization planning documents

## Document Status

All documents in this directory represent **draft or planning stages** that have been:
- **Successfully implemented** in the current production system
- **Superseded by finalized specifications** and operational systems
- **Completed** - the planned features are now operational

## Evolution to Current System

### From Planning to Implementation
- Draft architecture plans → Current containerized microservices architecture
- Risk optimization plans → Current operational risk management system  
- System optimization plans → Current M4 Max hardware-accelerated platform

### Implementation Success
- All planned features have been successfully implemented
- System performance exceeds original planning targets
- Architecture implementations match or exceed draft specifications

## Usage Guidelines

- **Historical Planning Reference**: Understand the planning process and evolution
- **Implementation Validation**: Compare original plans with current implementation
- **Decision Documentation**: Track decision-making process through development
