## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. JIT Compilation Framework

#### Numba Integration
```python
@njit(cache=True, fastmath=True)
def vectorized_risk_check(position_value: float, gross_exposure: float,
                         portfolio_value: float, daily_pnl: float,
                         position_values: np.ndarray, active_positions: int,
                         # ... limits
                         ) -> int:
    # All risk rules in single compiled function
    # Returns violation code or 0 for success
```

#### Performance Benefits
- **Compilation Caching**: JIT functions cached for immediate reuse
- **Fast Math**: Aggressive floating-point optimizations
- **SIMD Vectorization**: Automatic vectorization of loops
- **Parallel Processing**: `prange` for parallel execution

### 2. SIMD Vectorization Implementation

#### Memory-Aligned Arrays
```python
# Pre-allocated arrays for SIMD operations
quantities = np.zeros(1000, dtype=np.float64)      # Aligned
prices = np.zeros(1000, dtype=np.float64)          # Aligned
pnl_results = np.zeros(1000, dtype=np.float64)     # Aligned

# Vectorized P&L calculation
@njit(cache=True, fastmath=True)
def calculate_unrealized_pnl_vectorized(quantities, avg_prices, market_prices, 
                                       unrealized_pnl, active_positions):
    for i in prange(active_positions):  # Parallel SIMD loop
        pnl = quantities[i] * (market_prices[i] - avg_prices[i])
        unrealized_pnl[i] = pnl
```

#### Bulk Operations
- **1000+ positions** processed in single vectorized operation
- **Portfolio aggregation** in single pass
- **Price updates** with SIMD-optimized bulk operations

### 3. Lock-Free Architecture

#### Circular Buffer Implementation
```python
class LockFreeCircularBuffer:
    def __init__(self, size=16384):  # Power of 2
        self.mask = size - 1         # Fast modulo
        self.buffer = [None] * size
        # Atomic head/tail pointers
        
    def try_enqueue(self, item) -> bool:
        # Lock-free enqueue with CAS-like operations
        # Returns immediately if buffer full
```
