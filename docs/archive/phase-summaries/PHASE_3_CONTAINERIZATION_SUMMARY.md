    # Run 100 latency measurements for P99 calculation
    latencies = []
    for _ in range(100):
        start_time = time.time_ns()
        await integration_engine.process_test_order()
        latency_us = (time.time_ns() - start_time) / 1000
        latencies.append(latency_us)
    
    # Return P50, P95, P99 percentiles
