## Data Integration Architecture - Hybrid MessageBus + REST Design

The Nautilus platform uses a **sophisticated hybrid architecture** combining event-driven MessageBus integration with traditional REST APIs, optimized for different data source characteristics and use cases.

### MessageBus-Enabled Sources (Event-Driven Architecture)
**Current Sources**: Data.gov, DBnomics  
**Pattern**: Async event processing with pub/sub messaging via Redis streams

**When MessageBus is Used**:
- **High-volume data sources** (346K+ datasets, 800M+ time series)
- **Complex workflows** requiring async processing and queuing
- **Batch operations** that benefit from event-driven coordination
- **Data sources** where pub/sub patterns enable horizontal scaling

**MessageBus Architecture Pattern**:
```
/backend/
├── [source]_routes.py           # Traditional REST endpoints for compatibility
├── [source]_messagebus_routes.py # Event-triggered endpoints
└── [source]_messagebus_service.py # Event handlers & pub/sub logic
```

**Event Types**:
- `*.health_check` - Service health monitoring
- `*.request` - Data retrieval requests  
- `*.search` - Complex search operations
- `*.response` - Async response delivery
- `*.error` - Error handling and retry logic

### Direct REST API Sources (Request/Response Architecture)
**Current Sources**: IBKR, Alpha Vantage, FRED, EDGAR, Trading Economics  
**Pattern**: Synchronous HTTP API calls with direct response handling

**When Direct REST is Used**:
- **Real-time trading operations** (IBKR) - latency-critical, sub-millisecond requirements
- **Simple request/response patterns** (Alpha Vantage, FRED) - no async processing needed
- **Rate-limited APIs** (Alpha Vantage: 5 req/min) - direct control for quota management
- **Regulatory data** (EDGAR) - straightforward compliance data retrieval
- **Legacy integrations** being gradually migrated to MessageBus

### Performance & Scaling Trade-offs

| **Aspect** | **MessageBus** | **Direct REST** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Latency** | Higher (async) | Lower (direct) |
| **Throughput** | Higher (queued) | Limited (sync) |
| **Scalability** | Horizontal (pub/sub) | Vertical (connection pool) |
| **Complexity** | Higher (event handling) | Lower (simple HTTP) |
| **Error Handling** | Retry/dead letter queues | Immediate failure |
| **Rate Limiting** | Queue-based throttling | Direct API limits |

### Decision Matrix for New Data Sources

**Use MessageBus When**:
- ✅ Data volume > 100K records/operations
- ✅ Complex multi-step processing workflows
- ✅ Batch operations and background processing
- ✅ Multiple consumers need the same data
- ✅ Horizontal scaling requirements
- ✅ Async processing acceptable

**Use Direct REST When**:
- ✅ Real-time/low-latency requirements (< 100ms)
- ✅ Simple request/response patterns
- ✅ Rate-limited external APIs requiring direct control
- ✅ Trading operations requiring immediate response
- ✅ Regulatory/compliance data with audit trails
- ✅ Legacy system integration

### Future Migration Strategy
**Phase 1**: Continue hybrid approach for optimal performance  
**Phase 2**: Evaluate Alpha Vantage and FRED for MessageBus migration  
**Phase 3**: Keep IBKR direct for trading latency requirements  
**Phase 4**: All new sources default to MessageBus unless latency-critical  

## Network & Latency Architecture

The Nautilus platform implements a **multi-tier latency architecture** optimized for different use cases, from sub-10ms trading operations to 5-second batch processing.
