- Complete microservices transition

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Impact Assessment
```
Engine Type          | Current Latency | Containerized Est. | Impact
Order Execution      | <0.5ms         | <2ms              | Acceptable
Real-Time Risk       | <1ms           | <3ms              | Manageable  
Position Keeper      | <0.1ms         | <1ms              | Critical
Smart Order Router   | <2ms           | <5ms              | Acceptable
```

### Resource Requirements
- **CPU**: +20-30% overhead for container management
- **Memory**: +15-25% for container isolation
- **Network**: New inter-service communication patterns

## Decision Matrix

**Recommendation**: **Selective Containerization** approach
- Containerize high-value, scalable engines
- Maintain integrated architecture for ultra-low latency components
- Preserve hybrid benefits while enabling targeted scaling

**Status**: Architecture analysis complete - ready for selective implementation based on business priorities.
