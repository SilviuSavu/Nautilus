# Engine Containerization Architecture Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the migration from a monolithic backend architecture to a **fully containerized multi-engine system** leveraging the enhanced MessageBus for 50x+ performance improvements.

### Current Architecture Issues
- **GIL bottleneck**: 9 engines serialize execution within single Python process
- **Resource contention**: All engines compete for CPU/memory/I/O
- **No fault isolation**: One engine failure affects entire system
- **Limited scalability**: Can only scale vertically
- **Blocking operations**: Heavy computations block all other engines

### Target Architecture Benefits  
- **True parallel processing**: Each engine runs in isolated container
- **50x+ performance improvement**: 50,000+ ops/sec system capability
- **Horizontal scaling**: Scale individual engines based on load
- **Complete fault isolation**: Engine failures don't cascade
- **Resource optimization**: Right-size containers per engine needs
