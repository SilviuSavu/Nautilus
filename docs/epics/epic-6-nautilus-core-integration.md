# Epic 6: NautilusTrader Core Engine Integration

## Status
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL PRIORITY** - Not Started (0/4 stories complete: 6.1 ðŸš¨, 6.2 ðŸš¨, 6.3 ðŸš¨, 6.4 ðŸš¨)

**Epic Goal**: **URGENT** - Integrate the core NautilusTrader engine to enable live trading, backtesting, and algorithmic strategy deployment - the platform's primary value proposition that is currently completely missing from the UI.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Analysis Findings

### **SHOW-STOPPING GAP IDENTIFIED**
Based on comprehensive analysis of NautilusTrader capabilities vs UI implementation, **the core NautilusTrader engine integration is 0% implemented**. This represents a fundamental architectural gap that prevents the platform from delivering its primary value proposition.

### **Business Impact Assessment**

## ðŸš¨ Critical Implementation Priority

### **Why This Epic Is Urgent:**

1. **Foundation Without Core**: Current epics build peripheral features without the core engine
2. **User Value Gap**: Platform appears functional but cannot execute its primary purpose
3. **Architecture Risk**: Delaying core integration increases technical debt
4. **Business Risk**: Cannot deliver on algorithmic trading promises

### **Implementation Strategy:**

#### **Phase 1: Engine Integration (Weeks 1-2) - CRITICAL**
```bash
# Immediate actions required:
1. Uncomment nautilus_trader imports in main.py
2. Implement basic engine lifecycle controls  
3. Create engine status monitoring
4. Establish WebSocket bridge to engine
```

#### **Phase 2: Backtesting UI (Weeks 3-4) - HIGH**
```bash
1. Build backtest configuration interface
2. Implement results visualization
3. Create performance analysis tools
4. Add export capabilities
```

#### **Phase 3: Strategy Deployment (Weeks 5-6) - HIGH**  
```bash
1. Create deployment pipeline interface
2. Implement live strategy monitoring
3. Add safety and approval controls
4. Build rollback mechanisms
```

#### **Phase 4: Data Management (Weeks 7-8) - MEDIUM**
```bash
1. Build data catalog browser
2. Implement quality monitoring
3. Create export/import tools
4. Add data pipeline management
```

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### **Backend Changes Required:**
```python
# In main.py - CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:
# 1. Uncomment these imports:
from nautilus_ib_routes import router as nautilus_ib_router
from nautilus_strategy_routes import router as nautilus_strategy_router

# 2. Add engine management endpoints:
from nautilus_engine_service import NautilusEngineManager

# 3. Create WebSocket bridge:
from nautilus_websocket_bridge import NautilusWebSocketBridge
```

### **Frontend Architecture:**
```typescript
// Required store management:
- useNautilusEngine() - Engine state and controls
- useBacktestManager() - Backtest operations  
- useStrategyDeployment() - Strategy lifecycle
- useDataCatalog() - Data management

// Required service integrations:
- NautilusEngineService.ts
- BacktestService.ts  
- StrategyDeploymentService.ts
- DataCatalogService.ts
```

## Integration with Existing Epics

### **Epic Dependencies:**
- **Epic 1** âœ…: Foundation infrastructure ready

2. **Live Trading Safety** - Must implement comprehensive safety controls
3. **Performance Impact** - Engine integration must maintain system performance
4. **Data Consistency** - Ensure data pipeline reliability

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Phased Implementation** - Start with basic engine controls
2. **Extensive Testing** - Paper trading before live deployment
3. **Safety First** - Multiple confirmation layers for live trading
4. **Monitoring Focus** - Comprehensive health monitoring throughout
