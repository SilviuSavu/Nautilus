# 🎯 Epic: From "UI Theater" to Live Trading Platform

## Epic Overview

**Status**: Ready for Sprint Planning  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical System Foundation  
**Timeline**: 8 Weeks  
**Epic ID**: EPIC-2024-001  

### Problem Statement

The current Nautilus platform presents a beautiful, professional UI that creates an illusion of comprehensive functionality. However, critical investigation reveals:

- "Start Engine" button doesn't actually start anything
- Authentication errors block basic engine management
- 676 TODOs/stubs/mocks throughout the codebase causing system instability
- Beautiful dashboards display mock data instead of real trading information
- Order placement interfaces exist but don't execute actual trades

**The Result**: A sophisticated-looking platform that functions as "UI Theater" rather than a live trading system.

### Epic Goal

Transform the Nautilus platform from an impressive demo into a fully functional, production-ready trading system where every UI interaction delivers the expected functionality.
