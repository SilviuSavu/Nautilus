# NautilusTrader Web Dashboard Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• **Professional Trading Interface**: Create a web-based dashboard that transforms NautilusTrader's command-line experience into an intuitive, real-time trading interface suitable for quantitative traders and hedge funds

• **Real-Time Market Visualization**: Provide comprehensive market data visualization, order book depth, and multi-timeframe charting with microsecond precision updates

• **Strategy Management and Control**: Enable visual strategy configuration, deployment, monitoring, and performance analysis without requiring command-line expertise

• **Risk Management Dashboard**: Implement real-time portfolio monitoring, position tracking, and risk alerting with professional-grade analytics

• **First-to-Market Advantage**: Capture the strategic opportunity to be the first professional trading UI for the high-performance NautilusTrader ecosystem

### Background Context

The official NautilusTrader roadmap explicitly excludes UI development, creating a significant market opportunity for a complementary web-based trading dashboard. While NautilusTrader delivers exceptional performance through its hybrid Rust/Python architecture and event-driven design, it currently operates exclusively through command-line interfaces and Jupyter notebooks. This creates a barrier for professional traders and institutions who require visual trading interfaces for real-time decision making, strategy monitoring, and risk management.

The platform's sophisticated infrastructure—including its MessageBus system, Redis/PostgreSQL data stores, and real-time streaming capabilities—provides an ideal foundation for external UI integration. Our research indicates strong demand from the quantitative trading community for professional-grade interfaces that don't compromise the platform's performance characteristics, positioning this dashboard as a valuable ecosystem complement.
