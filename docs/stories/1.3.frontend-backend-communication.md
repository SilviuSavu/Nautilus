## Browser Testing Procedures

### Quick Start Testing Guide

**Prerequisites:**
1. Start backend server: `cd backend && python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002`
2. Start frontend server: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (will auto-assign port, typically 3001)

**Testing URLs:**
- **Main Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3001/simple-dashboard.html` ✅ WORKING
- **Debug Tools**: `http://localhost:3001/debug.html`, `/minimal-test.html`
- **React App**: `http://localhost:3001/` ⚠️ May show white screen (use dashboard instead)

### WebSocket Communication Testing

**1. Backend Connection Test:**
- Navigate to dashboard
- Verify "✅ Backend Connected" status (green)
- Backend URL should show `http://localhost:8002`

**2. WebSocket Connection Test:**
- WebSocket should auto-connect to `ws://localhost:8002/ws`
- Check browser DevTools → Network → WS tab for active connection
- Monitor console for connection logs

**3. Real-time Message Flow:**
- Messages should appear in real-time in dashboard components
- Performance metrics should update automatically
- Latency should be tracked and displayed (target: <100ms)

**4. Connection Management:**
- Test disconnect/reconnect functionality
- Verify automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Check connection status indicators update correctly

### Performance Validation

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- **Connection Establishment**: < 2 seconds
- **Message Latency**: < 100ms (displayed in PerformanceMonitor)
- **Reconnection Time**: < 5 seconds after disconnect
- **Message Throughput**: 100+ messages/second support

**Browser Console Commands for Testing:**
```javascript
// Access WebSocket service directly
window.webSocketService?.getConnectionStatus()
window.webSocketService?.getPerformanceMetrics()

// Send test message
window.webSocketService?.send('{"type": "test", "data": "hello"}')
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**White Screen on Main React App:**
- Use `/simple-dashboard.html` instead - this is the working dashboard
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Node.js dependencies are installed

**Backend Connection Errors:**
- Verify backend is running on port 8002
- Check CORS settings include current frontend port
- Ensure no firewall blocking local connections

**WebSocket Connection Failures:**
- Check backend WebSocket endpoint at `/ws`
- Verify frontend WebSocket URL matches backend port
- Monitor browser DevTools for WebSocket connection attempts
