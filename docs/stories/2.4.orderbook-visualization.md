## Implementation Details

### Key Files to Create/Modify

**New Components:**
- `src/components/OrderBook/OrderBookDisplay.tsx` - Main order book visualization component
- `src/components/OrderBook/OrderBookLevel.tsx` - Individual price level component
- `src/components/OrderBook/OrderBookHeader.tsx` - Spread and best prices display
- `src/components/OrderBook/OrderBookControls.tsx` - Aggregation and display controls

**Services & Hooks:**
- `src/hooks/useOrderBookData.ts` - Real-time order book data hook
- `src/services/orderBookService.ts` - Order book data processing and normalization
- `src/types/orderBook.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for order book data

**Existing Files to Modify:**
- `src/services/websocket.ts` - Add order book message type handling
- `src/components/IBDashboard.tsx` - Integrate order book component
- `src/components/Chart/InstrumentSelector.tsx` - Add order book trigger

### Data Integration

**WebSocket Message Types:**
```typescript
interface OrderBookMessage {
  type: 'order_book_update';
  symbol: string;
  venue: string;
  bids: OrderBookLevel[];
  asks: OrderBookLevel[];
  timestamp: number;
}

interface OrderBookLevel {
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
  orderCount?: number;
}
```

**Backend API Endpoints:**
- Uses existing IB Gateway connection from `backend/ib_gateway_client.py`
- Extends `backend/market_data_service.py` for order book subscriptions
- Leverages `backend/market_data_handlers.py` for data normalization

**Data Flow:**
1. IB Gateway → Backend WebSocket → Frontend WebSocket → OrderBook Component
2. Uses existing WebSocket service in `src/services/websocket.ts`
3. Data throttling at service level (max 10 updates/second per symbol)

### Architecture Integration

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
IBDashboard
├── InstrumentSelector (triggers order book subscription)
├── OrderBookDisplay
│   ├── OrderBookHeader (spread, best prices)
│   ├── OrderBookLevel[] (bid levels)
│   ├── OrderBookLevel[] (ask levels)
│   └── OrderBookControls (aggregation settings)
```

**State Management:**
- Uses existing React hooks pattern (similar to `useChartData`)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket subscription
- Local state for UI preferences (aggregation level, display depth)

- `backend/market_data_handlers.py:156-203` - Order book data normalization
- `src/services/websocket.ts:45-89` - WebSocket message handling patterns

### Previous Stories
- **Story 2.1**: IB Gateway WebSocket Connection (COMPLETE) - Provides data source
- **Story 2.2**: Market Data Streaming Infrastructure (COMPLETE) - Provides data pipeline  
- **Story 2.3**: Real-time Price Display (COMPLETE) - Provides WebSocket patterns

### Component Patterns
- Follow existing chart component structure in `src/components/Chart/ChartComponent.tsx`
- Use similar real-time data patterns from `src/components/Instruments/RealtimePriceDisplay.tsx`
- Apply consistent styling from `src/components/Chart/` components

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
**File**: `src/components/OrderBook/__tests__/OrderBookDisplay.test.tsx`
```typescript
describe('OrderBookDisplay', () => {
  test('renders bid/ask levels correctly');
  test('calculates spread accurately');
  test('handles empty order book gracefully');
  test('aggregates price levels by specified increment');
  test('highlights best bid/offer prices');
});
```

**File**: `src/services/__tests__/orderBookService.test.ts`
```typescript
describe('OrderBookService', () => {
  test('normalizes IB Gateway order book data');
  test('aggregates price levels correctly');
  test('throttles high-frequency updates');
  test('handles data validation and errors');
});
```

### Integration Tests
**File**: `src/components/OrderBook/__tests__/OrderBookIntegration.test.tsx`
```typescript
describe('OrderBook Integration', () => {
  test('subscribes to order book data on instrument selection');
  test('unsubscribes when component unmounts');
  test('handles WebSocket connection loss gracefully');
  test('displays real-time updates within latency requirements');
});
```

### Performance Tests
**File**: `src/components/OrderBook/__tests__/OrderBookPerformance.test.tsx`
```typescript
describe('OrderBook Performance', () => {
  test('handles 100+ price level updates per second');
  test('memory usage remains stable during extended sessions');
  test('render time stays under 16ms for smooth 60fps');
  test('aggregation calculations complete within 10ms');
});
```

### Test Data & Mocking
**Mock Data Source**: `src/test-utils/mockOrderBookData.ts`
```typescript
export const mockOrderBookData = {
  high_frequency: generateOrderBook({ levels: 20, updateFreq: 100 }),
  deep_book: generateOrderBook({ levels: 50, spread: 0.01 }),
  empty_book: { bids: [], asks: [], timestamp: Date.now() }
};
```

**WebSocket Mocking**: Use existing patterns from chart component tests
- Mock WebSocket service responses
- Simulate connection loss/reconnection
- Test throttling behavior with high-frequency mock data

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Real-time Updates**: Order book responds to price changes within 100ms
2. **Deep Book Handling**: Efficiently renders 50+ price levels without performance degradation  
3. **Connection Recovery**: Graceful handling of WebSocket disconnection/reconnection
4. **Data Validation**: Proper error handling for malformed or missing order book data
5. **Aggregation Accuracy**: Price level grouping maintains mathematical precision
6. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks during extended real-time sessions

### Acceptance Test Automation
**Playwright Tests**: `tests/e2e/orderbook.spec.ts`
- Select instrument → Verify order book appears
- Verify real-time price updates in browser
- Test aggregation controls functionality
- Validate visual appearance and animations

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required Completed Stories
- ✅ **Story 2.1**: IB Gateway WebSocket Connection - Provides data source infrastructure
- ✅ **Story 2.2**: Market Data Streaming Infrastructure - Provides data pipeline and normalization
- ✅ **Story 2.3**: Real-time Price Display - Provides WebSocket integration patterns

### Backend Requirements
- IB Gateway connection with market data permissions (Level II data required)
- Order book data subscription capability in `backend/ib_gateway_client.py`
- WebSocket message handling for order book updates

### Frontend Prerequisites  
- Existing WebSocket service infrastructure
- Instrument selection mechanism (from previous stories)
- Real-time component patterns established

### External Dependencies
- IB Gateway with Level II market data permissions
- Active instrument subscription (from instrument selector)
- PostgreSQL for order book data persistence (optional for this story)

## Performance & Technical Constraints

### Latency Requirements
- **Order book updates**: < 100ms from IB Gateway to UI display
- **UI rendering**: < 16ms per frame for smooth 60fps animations
- **Data processing**: < 10ms for aggregation calculations

### Memory Constraints
- Maximum 10MB memory usage for order book data structures
- Efficient cleanup of historical price levels
- Throttled updates to prevent memory bloat

### Data Volume Expectations
- **Typical**: 10-20 price levels, 5-10 updates/second
- **Peak**: 50+ price levels, 100+ updates/second  
- **Aggregation**: Group levels to maximum 20 displayed levels

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **High-frequency updates overwhelming UI**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement update throttling at service level
2. **IB Gateway Level II data permissions**
   - *Mitigation*: Graceful degradation with error message for insufficient permissions
3. **WebSocket connection instability**
   - *Mitigation*: Use existing reconnection logic from previous stories

### Implementation Risks
1. **Complex aggregation logic**
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple fixed-increment aggregation
2. **Performance bottlenecks**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement performance monitoring and progressive enhancement

## Notes

- Implement order book data throttling to prevent UI overload
- Consider price level grouping for deep books
- Add price level click handlers for order placement (future story)
- Ensure proper handling of venue-specific book formats
- Follow existing component patterns from Chart components for consistency
