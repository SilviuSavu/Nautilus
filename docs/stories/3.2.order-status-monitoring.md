- Order book integration for visual placement
- Notification system for status changes
- Error handling for modification/cancellation failures

### Dependencies
- NautilusTrader execution engine events
- Order book visualization component
- Real-time messaging system
- User notification framework

## Definition of Done

- [x] Live order status display shows all states (pending, partial, filled, cancelled)
- [x] Order modification and cancellation capabilities functional
- [x] Execution updates display fill prices and quantities accurately
- [x] Order book integration shows order placement visually
- [x] Real-time notifications for order state changes working

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The IBDashboard.tsx implementation demonstrates senior-level code quality with comprehensive real-time order status monitoring functionality. The implementation exceeds the story requirements with professional-grade features including real-time WebSocket updates, proper error handling, and intuitive user interface design.

**Strengths:**
- Clean, well-organized React component with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive real-time order status updates via WebSocket (`ib_order` message type)
- Professional order management with dedicated modify/cancel functionality
- Proper error handling and user notifications
- Responsive design with color-coded status indicators
- Well-structured column definitions for orders table

### Refactoring Performed

**Significant refactoring and code quality improvements implemented:**

- **File**: `/frontend/src/hooks/useOrderManagement.ts`
  - **Change**: Extracted order management logic from IBDashboard into reusable custom hook
  - **Why**: Improves code reusability, testability, and separation of concerns
  - **How**: Isolated order modify, cancel, and utility functions with proper loading state management

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards: ✓** - Follows TypeScript/React conventions, uses camelCase for variables, meaningful naming
- **Project Structure: ✓** - Component is properly placed in `/frontend/src/components/`
- **Testing Strategy: ✓** - Comprehensive unit test coverage implemented for order management functionality
- **All ACs Met: ✓** - All acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional
