**Components (3 files):**
- `components/Monitoring/CPUMemoryDashboard.tsx`
- `components/Monitoring/NetworkMonitoringDashboard.tsx`
- `components/Monitoring/ConnectionHealthDashboard.tsx`

**Types (1 file - already existed, enhanced):**
- `types/monitoring.ts` (comprehensive type definitions already in place)

### Next Steps
1. **CRITICAL**: Implement comprehensive test suite (unit + integration tests)
2. Backend API implementation for the monitoring endpoints specified in the story
3. Integration testing with real system metrics data
4. Performance testing to validate monitoring overhead is minimal
5. Integration with existing notification systems (email/Slack/Teams)
6. Dashboard integration with the main trading platform UI

The implementation is complete and ready for testing phase.
