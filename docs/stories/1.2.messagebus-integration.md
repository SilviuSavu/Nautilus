# Story 1.2: NautilusTrader MessageBus Integration

**Epic**: Foundation & Integration Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: 1.2  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimate**: 8 Story Points  

## Status
Done

## User Story

As a backend developer,  
I want to establish WebSocket connection to NautilusTrader's MessageBus,  
so that the dashboard can receive real-time trading events and market data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **MessageBus Connection**: FastAPI backend connects to NautilusTrader MessageBus via WebSocket
2. **Health Monitoring**: Connection health monitoring with automatic reconnection logic
3. **Message Processing**: Basic message parsing and routing to appropriate handlers
4. **Status API**: Connection status exposed via REST API endpoint
5. **Error Handling**: Error handling and logging for connection failures

## Technical Requirements

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Story 1.1 Prerequisites** [Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-setup-docker.md]:
- Docker Compose environment running (frontend, backend, Redis)
- FastAPI backend accessible at localhost:8000
- Redis service configured for state management
- Environment variables configured from Story 1.1 setup

### NautilusTrader MessageBus Integration Details
**Connection Configuration**:
- **Integration Method**: Redis Streams (not direct WebSocket to NautilusTrader)
- **Redis Connection**: Use existing Redis service from Docker Compose
- **Stream Names**: `nautilus:events`, `nautilus:market_data`, `nautilus:orders`
- **Message Format**: JSON with timestamp and message_type fields
- **Authentication**: Redis AUTH from environment variables

**Expected Message Types**:
```json
// Market Data Event
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-16T10:30:00.123456Z",
  "message_type": "market_data",
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "bid": 1.0825,
  "ask": 1.0827,
  "volume": 1000000
}

// Order Event
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-16T10:30:00.123456Z", 
  "message_type": "order_update",
  "order_id": "ORD-123456",
  "status": "FILLED",
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "quantity": 100000
}

// Connection Heartbeat
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-16T10:30:00.123456Z",
  "message_type": "heartbeat",
  "status": "connected"
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Context
**Reference Documents** [Source: nautilus_trader/CLAUDE.md]:
- NautilusTrader uses MessageBus for event-driven communication backbone
- MessageBus supports pub/sub and req/rep patterns
- Integration should follow NautilusTrader's event-driven architecture patterns
- Core components: DataEngine, ExecutionEngine communicate via MessageBus

### Technical Implementation Guidelines
- Ensure connection state is persisted in Redis for multi-process environments
- Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s)
- Consider message queuing for handling bursts during reconnection
- Log all connection events for debugging and monitoring
- Use async/await patterns throughout for non-blocking message processing
- Implement proper error handling for malformed messages and connection failures

### Development Standards
**Redis Stream Integration** [Based on implementation findings]:
- Stream consumer groups for reliable message processing
- Acknowledge messages after successful processing
- Handle stream timeouts and reconnection gracefully
- Use Redis XREAD with block parameter for efficient polling

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Tests** [Required coverage]:
- MessageBus client connection/disconnection scenarios
- Message parsing for all defined message types
- Error handling for malformed JSON and network failures
- Exponential backoff reconnection logic
- Health monitoring state transitions

**Integration Tests** [End-to-end scenarios]:
- Redis stream message flow from producer to consumer
- WebSocket server broadcasting to multiple frontend clients
- Performance validation of latency requirements
- Connection recovery during Redis service restart
