**Performance-First Animation:** All animations must support rather than hinder trading performance. Real-time data updates take priority over decorative motion. Use animation to communicate state changes, guide attention to critical information, and provide immediate feedback for user actions without creating visual noise during rapid market movements.

### Key Animations

- **Data Update Flash:** Subtle cell background flash on value changes (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Order Status Transition:** Progressive color transition for order state changes (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)  
- **Alert Slide-In:** Critical alerts slide from top with bounce attention (Duration: 500ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55))
- **Panel Expansion:** Smooth panel resize for detailed views (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Connection Status Pulse:** Gentle pulsing for reconnection states (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: ease-in-out, Infinite)
- **Hover State Transition:** Immediate button/link hover feedback (Duration: 100ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading Spinner:** Professional loading indicator for data fetching (Duration: 800ms, Easing: linear, Infinite)
- **Confirmation Dialog:** Modal appearance with backdrop fade (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Chart Crosshair:** Smooth crosshair movement following mouse (Duration: 50ms, Easing: linear)
- **Tab Switching:** Instant content swap with subtle underline slide (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial dashboard load under 2 seconds on standard broadband connections
- **Interaction Response:** All user interactions (clicks, form inputs, navigation) respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60 FPS for all animations and real-time data updates during peak market activity

### Design Strategies

**Efficient Rendering Architecture:** Implement React virtualization for large data sets (trade history, order books), use CSS containment for isolated panel updates, minimize DOM reflows through fixed panel layouts, and leverage Web Workers for complex calculations (P&L attribution, risk metrics) that don't block UI rendering.

**Real-Time Data Optimization:** Implement intelligent update throttling that batches rapid market data updates while preserving critical price movements, use differential updates to only re-render changed data cells, implement progressive enhancement where secondary data loads after critical trading information, and utilize WebSocket connection pooling for efficient real-time communication with NautilusTrader backend.

**Memory Management:** Implement data windowing for historical data to prevent memory leaks during extended trading sessions, use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed components (order entries, data rows), implement proper cleanup for event listeners and subscriptions, and cache frequently accessed reference data (instrument details, venue information) with intelligent refresh policies.

**Visual Performance:** Use CSS transforms for all animations to leverage GPU acceleration, implement smart repainting strategies that isolate update regions, minimize expensive CSS operations (box-shadow, filters) during real-time updates, and use efficient data visualization libraries (Lightweight Charts) optimized for financial data rendering.
