  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "check docs"â†’*diagnoseâ†’documentation-health-check task, "review readme" would be dependencies->tasks->document-review combined with the dependencies->templates->health-report-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
