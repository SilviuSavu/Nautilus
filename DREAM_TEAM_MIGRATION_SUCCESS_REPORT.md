## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Transformation

### **BEFORE: Single Redis Bottleneck**
```
All 7 Engines → Single Redis (6379) → 22.11% CPU → 2.9M failed operations
```

### **AFTER: Dual MessageBus Architecture**
```
7 Engines → MarketData Bus (6380) → Market data distribution
7 Engines → Engine Logic Bus (6381) → Business logic communication
Main Redis (6379) → 0.22% CPU → Minimal backend operations only
```
