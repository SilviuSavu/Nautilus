# Story 5.2: System Performance Monitoring

**Epic**: Advanced Analytics & Performance Monitoring  
**Story ID**: 5.2  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimate**: 8 Story Points  

## User Story

As a trader,  
I want to monitor system performance and latency metrics,  
so that I can ensure optimal trading execution and identify bottlenecks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Latency Monitoring**: Real-time latency monitoring for data feeds and order execution
2. **System Dashboards**: System resource usage and performance dashboards
3. **Connection Quality**: Connection quality metrics for all venues
4. **Alert System**: Alert system for performance degradation
5. **Historical Analysis**: Historical performance data and trend analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time latency measurement and tracking
- System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, network)
- Connection quality metrics per venue
- Throughput and capacity monitoring

### Dashboard System
- Real-time performance dashboards
- Historical performance trend analysis
- Alert threshold configuration
- Performance degradation detection

### Data Collection
- Performance metrics collection framework
- Historical data storage and retrieval
- Trend analysis and reporting
- Anomaly detection system

### Dependencies
- System monitoring tools
- Performance metrics collection
- Time-series database
- Alerting infrastructure

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Real-time latency monitoring for data feeds and order execution
- [ ] System resource usage and performance dashboards implemented
- [ ] Connection quality metrics for all venues functional
- [ ] Alert system for performance degradation operational
- [ ] Historical performance data and trend analysis available
- [ ] Unit tests for monitoring logic
- [ ] Integration tests verify metric collection
- [ ] Performance tests validate monitoring overhead
- [ ] Alert system tests ensure proper notifications
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Notes

- Implement performance baseline establishment
- Add capacity planning recommendations
- Consider automated performance optimization
- Ensure monitoring doesn't impact trading performance
