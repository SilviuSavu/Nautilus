# Story 4.1: Strategy Configuration Interface

**Epic**: Strategy Management & Portfolio Dashboard  
**Story ID**: 4.1  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimate**: 13 Story Points  

## User Story

As a trader,  
I want to configure and deploy trading strategies through the dashboard,  
so that I can manage my algorithmic trading without command-line tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Strategy Templates**: Strategy template selection and parameter configuration
2. **Visual Builder**: Visual strategy builder with parameter validation
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Strategy deployment and lifecycle management
4. **Python Integration**: Integration with NautilusTrader's Python strategy framework
5. **Version Control**: Strategy versioning and rollback capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Strategy Configuration
