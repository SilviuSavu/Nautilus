## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story of the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this infrastructure setup story. Future stories will implement trading-specific data models.

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints required for this story. The FastAPI backend will be configured with basic health check endpoints:
- GET /health - Health check endpoint
- GET /api/v1/status - API status endpoint

### Component Specifications
