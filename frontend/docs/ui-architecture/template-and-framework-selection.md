# Template and Framework Selection

## Framework Assessment
Based on the provided frontend specification and NautilusTrader project structure, this architecture uses:

**Framework:** React 18+ with TypeScript
**Build Tool:** Vite (faster than Create React App, better for real-time performance)
**UI Foundation:** Ant Design + custom financial components
**State Management:** Zustand (lightweight, performant for real-time updates)
**WebSocket:** Native WebSocket + reconnection logic
**Charts:** Lightweight Charts (as specified in the UX doc)

**Key Rationale:**
- React + TypeScript provides type safety critical for financial data
- Vite offers superior hot reload and build performance
- Ant Design gives professional trading terminal aesthetics
- Zustand avoids Redux overhead for high-frequency updates
- This approach aligns with the <100ms update requirement
